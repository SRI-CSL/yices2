* When setting the model for the trail, round doubles to gmp integers.
** For NRA, convert to rationals (with a cap on num/dem)

* l2o.c:1004 and 1057: memory leak; use (const) pointers

* no int_hset_reset after init necessary

* don't use static fields (e.g. l2o.c: 191)

* all functions not explicitly part of the external interface of your component should be made static

* Some cast overflows (*not* evaluator.c:166)

* Use a list of terms for clauses, instead of one big sum term.

* l2o.c: get_composite: better to extract the code from the preprocessor towards term.c and avoid duplicating it

* .h file for evaluator and hill_climbing
