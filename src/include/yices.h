/***************************
 * OUT-OF-MEMORY CALLBACK  *
 **************************/

/*
 * By default, when Yices runs out of memory, it
 * first prints an error message on stderr; then it calls
 * exit(YICES_EXIT_OUT_OF_MEMORY).  This kills the whole process.
 *
 * The following function allows you to register a callback to invoke
 * if Yices runs out of memory.  The callback function takes no
 * arguments and returns nothing.
 *
 * Installing an out-of-memory callback allows you to do something a
 * bit less brutal than killing the process. If there's a callback,
 * yices will call it first when it runs out of memory.  The callback
 * function should not return. If it does, yices will call exit as
 * previously.
 *
 * In other words, the code that handles out-of-memory is as follows:
 *
 *   if (callback != NULL) {
 *     callback();
 *   } else {
 *     fprintf(stderr, ...);
 *   }
 *   exit(YICES_EXIT_OUT_OF_MEMORY);
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT
 * ---------
 * After Yices runs out of memory, its internal data structures may be
 * left in an inconsistent/corrupted state. The API is effectively
 * unusable at this point and nothing can be done to recover cleanly.
 * Evan a call to yices_exit() may cause a seg fault. The callback
 * should not try to cleanup anything, or call any function from the API.
 *
 * A plausible use of this callback feature is to implement an
 * exception mechanism using setjmp/longjmp.

 * Internal term structure:

 * - projection terms are of the form
 *    (constructor, index, child)
 *
 * - a sum is a term of the form

 ************************/

/*
 * By default, Yices never deletes any terms or types. All terms and
 * types returned by the functions above can always be used by the
 * application. There's no explicit term or type deletion function.
 *
 * If you want to delete terms or types that are no longer useful, you
 * must make an explicit call to the garbage collector by calling
 * function yices_garbage_collect.
 *
 * Yices uses a mark-and-sweep garbage collector. Given a set of root
 * terms and types that must be preserved, Yices marks the roots and
 * all the terms and types on which the roots depend.  After this
 * marking phase, all unmarked terms and types are deleted. Yices
 * includes several methods to specify the root terms and types that
 * you want to keep.
 *
 * First, there's a set of default roots, namely, every term or type
 * that is used by a live context or model. For example, if you call
 * yices_new_context to obtain a new context and assert formulas in
 * this context, then all these formulas are considered root terms
 * until you delete the context using yices_free_context.
 *
 * In addition, you can specify more roots using any of the following
 * mechanisms (they can be combined).
 *
 * 1) give a list of root terms and types as arguments to
 *    yices_garbage_collect.
 *
 * 2) set parameter 'keep_named' to true when calling
 *    yices_garbage_collect.
 *
 *    If this flag is true, any term or type that is stored in the
 *    symbol tables is added to the set of roots.
 *
 * 3) maintain reference counts for terms and types, using the functions
 *      yices_incref_term
 *      yices_decref_term
 *      yices_incref_type
 *      yices_decref_type
 *
 *    When yices_garbage_collect is called, all terms and all types with
 *    a positive reference count are considered roots. If you never
 *    call yices_incref_term or yices_incref_type, then the reference
 *    counting is disabled and it's not taken into account when calling
 *    yices_garbage_collect.
 *

/****************************
 *  CONTEXT CONFIGURATION   *
 ***************************/

/*
 * When a context is created, it is possible to configure it to use a
 * specific solver or a specific combination of solvers.  It is also
 * possible to specify whether or not the context should support
 * features such as push and pop.
 *
 * There are two solver types:
 * - dpllt: default solver based on DPLL modulo theories
 * - mcsat: solver based on the Model-Constructing Satisfiability Calculus
 *
 * The "mcsat" solver is required for formulas that use non-linear
 * arithmetic. Currently the mcsat solver does not support push and
 * pop. If you select "mcsat" as the solver type, no other
 * configuration is necessary.
 *
 * If you select "dpllt" as the solver type, then you can define the
 * combination of theory solvers you want to include.
 *
 * The following theory solvers are currently available:
 * - egraph (solver for uninterpreted functions)
 * - bitvector solver
 * - array solver
 * - solver for linear arithmetic based on simplex
 * - solver for integer difference logic (based on Floyd-Warshall)
 * - solver for real difference logic (also based on Floyd-Warshall)
 *
 * The following combinations of theory solvers can be used:
 * - no solvers at all
 * - egraph alone
 * - bitvector solver alone
 * - simplex solver alone
 * - integer Floyd-Warshall solver alone
 * - real Floyd-Warshall solver alone
 * - egraph + bitvector solver
 * - egraph + simplex solver
 * - egraph + array solver
 * - egraph + bitvector + array solver
 * - egraph + simplex + array solver
 * - egraph + simplex + bitvector + array solver
 *
 * If no solvers are used, the context can deal only with Boolean
 * formulas.
 *
 * When the simplex solver is used, it's also possible to
 * specify which arithmetic fragment is intended, namely:
 * - integer difference logic              (IDL)
 * - real difference logic                 (RDL)
 * - real linear arithmetic                (LRA)
 * - integer linear arithmetic             (LIA)
 * - mixed integer/real linear arithmetic  (LIRA)
 *
 * In addition to the solver combination, a context can be configured
 * for different usages:
 * - one-shot mode: check satisfiability of one set of formulas
 * - multiple checks: repeated calls to assert/check are allowed
 * - push/pop: push and pop are supported (implies multiple checks)
 * - clean interrupts are supported (implies push/pop)
 * Currently, the Floyd-Warshall solvers can only be used in one-shot mode.
 *
 * By default, a new solver is configured as follows:
 * - solvers: egraph + simplex + bitvector + array solver
 * - usage: push/pop supported
 *
 * To specify another configuration, one must pass a configuration
 * descriptor to function yices_new_context. A configuration descriptor
 * is an opaque structure that includes the following fields:
 * - arith-fragment: either IDL, RDL, LRA, LIA, or LIRA
 * - uf-solver: either NONE, DEFAULT
 * - bv-solver: either NONE, DEFAULT
 * - array-solver: either NONE, DEFAULT
 * - arith-solver: either NONE, DEFAULT, IFW, RFW, SIMPLEX
 * - mode: either ONE-SHOT, MULTI-CHECKS, PUSH-POP, INTERACTIVE
 *
 * This is done as follows:
 * 1) allocate a configuration descriptor via yices_new_config
 * 2) set the configuration parameters by repeated calls to yices_set_config
 *    or using yices_default_config_for_logic
 * 3) create one or more context with this configuration by passing the
 *    descriptor to yices_new_context
 * 4) free the configuration descriptor when it's no longer needed

/***************
 *  CONTEXTS   *
 **************/

/*
 * A context is a stack of assertions.
 *
 * The intended use is:
 * 1) create a context (empty)
 * 2) assert one or more formulas in the context.
 *    (it's allowed to call assert several times before check).
 * 3) check satisfiability
 * 4) if the context is satisfiable, optionally build a model
 * 5) reset the context or call push or pop, then go back to 2
 * 6) delete the context
 *
 *
 * A context can be in one of the following states:
 * 1) STATUS_IDLE: this is the initial state.
 *    In this state, it's possible to assert formulas.
 *    After assertions, the status may change to STATUS_UNSAT (if
 *    the assertions are trivially unsatisfiable). Otherwise
 *    the state remains STATUS_IDLE.
 *
 * 2) STATUS_SEARCHING: this is the context status during search.
 *    The context moves into that state after a call to 'check'
 *    and remains in that state until the solver completes
 *    or the search is interrupted.
 *
 * 3) STATUS_SAT/STATUS_UNSAT/STATUS_UNKNOWN: status returned after a search
 *    - STATUS_UNSAT means the assertions are not satisfiable.
 *    - STATUS_SAT means they are satisfiable.
 *    - STATUS_UNKNOWN means that the solver could not determine whether
 *      the assertions are satisfiable or not. This may happen if
 *      Yices is not complete for the specific logic used (e.g.,
 *      if the formula includes quantifiers).
 *
 * 4) STATUS_INTERRUPTED: if the context is in the STATUS_SEARCHING state,
 *    then it can be interrupted via a call to stop_search.
 *    The status STATUS_INTERRUPTED indicates that.
 *
 * For fine tuning: there are options that determine which internal
 * simplifications are applied when formulas are asserted, and
 * other options to control heuristics used by the solver.

 *
 *   learn-eq: enable/disable heuristics to learn implied equalities

 *   keep_subst = 0 means don't keep substitutions,

 * - ctx status must be STATUS_SAT or STATUS_UNKNOWN
 *
 * The function returns NULL if the status isn't SAT or STATUS_UNKNOWN
 * and sets an error report (code = CTX_INVALID_OPERATION).
 *
 * When assertions are added to the context, the simplifications may
 * eliminate some uninterpreted terms (cf. simplification options above).
 * The flag 'keep_subst' indicates whether the model should keep track
 * of these eliminated terms and include their value.
 *
 * Example: after the following assertions
 *
 *    (= x (bv-add y z))
 *    (bv-gt y 0b000)
 *    (bg-gt z 0b000)
 *
 * uninterpreted term 'x' gets eliminated. Then a call to 'check_context' will
 * return STATUS_SAT and we can ask for a model 'M'
 * - if 'keep_subst' is false then the value of 'x' in 'M' is unavailable.
 * - if 'keep_subst' is true then the value of 'x' in 'M' is computed,
 *   based on the value of 'y' and 'z' in 'M'.
 *
 * It's always better to set 'keep_subst' true. The only exceptions
 * are some of the large SMT_LIB benchmarks where millions of uninterpreted 
 * terms are eliminated.  In such cases, it saves memory to set 'keep_subst'

/*
 * The previous functions work for terms t of atomic types, but they
 * can't be used if t has a tuple or function type. Internally, yices
 * represent the tuple and function values as nodes in a DAG. The
 * following functions allows one to query and explore this DAG.
 * A node in the DAG is represented by a structure of type yval_t defined
 * as follows in yices_types.h:
 *
 *  typedef struct yval_s {
 *    int32_t node_id;
 *    yval_tag_t node_tag;
 *  } yval_t;
 *
 *
 * This descriptor includes the node id (all nodes have a unique id) and
 * a tag that identifies the node type. Leaf nodes represent atomic constants.
 * Non-leaf nodes represent tuples and functions.
 *
 * The possible tags for a leaf node are:
 *
 *   YVAL_BOOL       Boolean constant
 *   YVAL_RATIONAL   Rational (or integer) constant
 *   YVAL_ALGEBRAIC  Algebraic number
 *   YVAL_BV         Bitvector constant
 *   YVAL_SCALAR     Constant of a scalar or uninterpreted type
 *
 * The following tags are used for non-leaf nodes:
 *
 *   YVAL_TUPLE      Constant tuple
 *   YVAL_FUNCTION   Function
 *   YVAL_MAPPING    Mapping of the form [val_1 .. val_k -> val]
 *
 * There is also the special leaf node to indicate an error or that a value
 * is not known:
 *
 *   YVAL_UNKNOWN
 *
 *
 * The children of a tuple node denote the tuple components. For
 * example Yices will represent the tuple (true, -1/2, 0b0011) as a
 * node with tag YVAL_TUPLE and three children. Each children is a
 * leaf node in this case.
 *
 * All functions used in the model have a simple form. They are defined
 * by a finite list of mappings and a default value. Each mapping specifies the
 * value of the function at a single point in its domain. For example, we could
 * have a function f of type [int, int -> int] defined by the clauses:
 *    f(0, 0) = 0
 *    f(3, 1) = 1
 *    f(x, y) = -2 in all other cases.
 *
 * Yices represents such a function as a node with tag YVAL_FUNCTION
 * and with three children. Two of these children are nodes with tag
 * YVAL_MAPPING that represent the mappings:
 *     [0, 0 -> 0]
 *     [3, 1 -> 1]
 * The third children represents the default value for f. In this case,
 * it's a leaf node for the constant -2 (tag YVAL_RATIONAL and value -2).
 *
 * The following functions return the value of a term t as a node in
 * the DAG, and allow one to query and collect the children of
 * non-leaf nodes.

 * MODEL GENERALIZATION

 * terminology.
 *
 * Given a model mdl for a formula F(X, Y). The following generalization functions
 * eliminate variables Y from F(X, Y) in a way that is guided by the model.
 *
 * The result is a formula G(X) such that:
 * 1) mdl satisfies G(X)
 * 2) G(X) implies (exists Y. F(X, Y))
 *
 * Yices supports the following generalization methods:
 *
 * 1) generalization by substitution: eliminate the Y variables
 *    by replacing them by their value in mdl
 *    (this is the simplest approach)
 *
 * 2) generalization by projection:
 *    - first compute an implicant for formula F(X, Y)
 *      this produces a set of literals L_1(X, Y) .... L_k(X, Y)
 *    - then Y is eliminated from the literals by projection
 *      (this is a hybrid of Fourier-Motzkin elimination
 *       and virtual term substitution)
 *
 * In the functions below, the generalization method can be selected
 * by setting parameter mode to one of the following values:
 *
 *   mode = YICES_GEN_BY_SUBST  ---> generalize by substitution
 *   mode = YICES_GEN_BY_PROJ   ---> projection
 *   mode = YICES_GEN_DEFAULT   ---> automatically choose the mode
 *                                   depending on the variables to eliminate
 *
