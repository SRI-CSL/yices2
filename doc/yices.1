.SH NAME
yices \- the Yices SMT solver for the Yices language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yices
[
.I options
]
[
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs the Yices SMT solver. The input must be in the Yices specification
language. If no
.I file
is given, Yices reads commands from standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-version,  \-V
Display version and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help,  \-h
Display a short help summary.
.TP
.BI \-\-verbosity= level, \& " "  \-v  "" " " level
Set the verbosity level (default = 0).
.TP
.BI \-\-logic= name
Configure Yices for a specific logic.
.IP
The
.I name
must be either an SMT\-LIB logic name (e.g., QF_UFLIA)
or the special symbol NONE to select propositional logic.
.TP
.BI \-\-arith\-solver= solver
Select the arithmetic solver.
.IP
The
.I solver
may be either
.I simplex
or
.I floyd\-warshall
or \fIauto\fR.
This option is ignored unless the logic is either QF_RDL or QF_IDL.
.TP
.BI \-\-mode= mode
Select the usage mode.
.IP
The
.I mode
maybe \fIone\-shot\fR or \fImulti\-checks\fR or \fIinteractive\fR
or \fIpush\-pop\fR or \fIef\fR.
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
.I one\-shot:
only one call to (check) is allowed.
No assertions are allowed after (check).
Commands (push) and (pop) are not supported.
.IP \(bu 4
.I multi\-checks:
several calls (check) are allowed.
Adding assertions after check is allowed.
Commands (push) and (pop) are not supported.
.IP \(bu 4
.I push\-pop:
like
.I multi\-check
but with support for (push) and (pop).
.IP \(bu 4
.I interactive:
like
.I push\-pop.
In addition, Yices restores the context
to a clean state if (check) is interrupted.
.IP \(bu 4
.I ef:
enable the exist\-forall solver, that is, command (ef\-solve) can be used.
This is like
.I one\-shot
in that only one call to (ef\-solve) is allowed.
.RE
.IP
The default mode is \fIpush\-pop\fR.
.
.TP
.B \-\-mcsat
Force use of the MCSAT solver.
.TP
.B \-\-print\-success
Print
.I ok
after every command that would otherwise execute silently.
