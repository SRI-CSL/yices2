This file explains how to compile Yices on different platforms and how
to build binary distributions (with or without GMP).



CONTENT AND DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------------------

The source subdirectories include

  ./src:           source code for Yices proper

  ./tests:         source code for test programs

  ./doc:           documentation, notes

  ./utils:         shell scripts and other utilities

  ./examples:      example input files for testing

  ./etc:           miscellaneous files that get added to the tar files


The following subdirectories are created and used during compilation:

  ./configs:       configuration files for each platform. Each file stores
                   compilation options and other settings used by the Makefile(s).

  ./build:         where all object, executable, and library files are built

  ./distribution:  where the tar files are stored



The 'build' subdirectory is organized by platform + compilation mode:

The main compilation modes are 'release' and 'debug'. The default mode
is 'release'. Less common compilation modes are available for
profiling and help to debugging (cf. Makefile).

The default compilation platform is whatever 'config.guess' returns,
but some systems can have variant platforms (e.g., a 32bit build on a
64bit Linux system).

Example: on an Intel Mac, there may be four subdirectories under build:

  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release     (32bits/release)
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-debug       (32bits/debug)
  ./build/x86_64-apple-darwin8.9.1-release   (64bits/release)
  ./build/x86_64-apple-dawrin8.9.1-debug     (64bits/debug)



Each of these directories contains subdirectories for objects,
libraries, and binaries. In a build mode, there are two variant
compilations, namely, with or without GMP statically linked.  This
gives 6 different subdirectories for each pair platform/build mode.
For example:

  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/obj
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/lib
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/bin

  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/static_obj
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/static_lib
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/static_bin


These six directories are where the binaries/objects/library
files are stored during compilation.


When a binary distribution is built, the relevant files are first
copied into one of the subdirectories:

  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/dist
  ./build/i386-apple-darwin8.9.1-release/static_dist


Then, the tarfiles are built from the content of the
dist or static_dist directories. The tarfiles are then
stored into

  ./distributions

This is also where the source tarfile is stored if a source
distribution is built.





CONFIGURATION
-------------

1) Basics

Configuration files are generated by './configure', and are kept
separate for each platform. They are stored in the ./configs
subdirectory, with a name of the form 'make.include.<platform>'.
Each configuration file is derived from 'make.include.in' by the
'./configure' script.

The rationale for this organization is to support parallel compilation
on several machines from the same source directory (i.e., without
having to run ./configure every time on each machine). Yices 1.0.xx
does not allow this and that's a pain whenever we release a new
version.

The main 'Makefile' in the top-level directory determines the
architecture and OS, and checks the compilation mode. The platform is
determined from the architecture and OS and 'make' reads the
configuration file for that platform. This sets several variables that
are passed to a recursive make:

  ARCH=<target-platform>
  POSIXOS=<operating system>
  YICES_TOP_DIR=<top-level directory>
  YICES_MAKE_INCLUDE=<config file to use>
  YICES_MODE=<compilation mode>
  YICES_VERSION=2.x.y
  MAJOR=2
  MINOR=x
  PATCH_LEVEL=y


To see how these variables are set, type 

  'make show-config' or 'make show-config MODE=<mode>'.

For example, on a linux/x86_64 platform, 'make show-config MODE=debug' 
gives

  ARCH is x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  POSIXOS is linux
  YICES_TOP_DIR is /homes/bruno/yices2
  YICES_MAKE_INCLUDE is configs/make.include.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  YICES_MODE is debug
  YICES_VERSION is 2.x.y


More variables are set during configuration. For trouble-shooting, you
can see the full list by typing 

   'make show-details' 

in the toplevel Yices directory. In most cases, these variables (CC,
LD, etc.) are set to good default values, but the defaults may be
overridden by giving options to the ./configure script.



2) Configuration options

The usual options can be given to './configure' and the usual
environment variables are taken into account (CC, CFLAGS, LD,
LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, etc.).  Type './configure --help' for details.



3) GMP library location

There are Yices-specific options for dealing with GMP complications.
Building Yices may require as many as three different GMP libraries:

  - dynamic library (e.g., /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so)

  - static library (e.g., /usr/local/lib/libgmp.a)

  - for some platforms, another version of libgmp.a compiled
    as position independent code may also be required.

In addition, on Cygwin and Mingw, the static and dynamic GMP library
require different header files 'gmp.h'.


The ./configure script tries to locate these libraries and header
files in default locations. If that fails, or if the defaults are
wrong,  the following options can be given to ./configure:

   --with-static-gmp=<path to libgmp.a>
   --with-static-gmp-include-dir=<directory of the corresponding 'gmp.h'>

   --with-pic-gmp=<path to PIC libgmp,a>
   --with-pic-gmp-include-dir=<directory of the corresponding 'gmp.h'>


NOTE: the --with-pic-gmp is useful only if your want to build a static
      Yices distribution and if libgmp.a is not position-independent by
      default.



4) Alternative platforms

To set the platform to something else than the default, give option

   --build=<platform>  or  --host=<platform>

to ./configure. This will store compilation flags for this platform in
file './configs/make.include.<platform>'. Then this configuration file
can be selected by giving an argument of the form 'OPTION=...' to the
'make' command.


For example, the default platform for a Linux/64bit machine is

  'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'.

It may be possible to compile for 32bit on the same machine
(depending on compiler and libraries). To configure for 32bit
compilation, we build for the alternative platform

  'i686-unknown-linux-gnu'

This is done by first building a configuration file:

   ./configure --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu CFLAGS=-m32 ...

then selecting this configuration by typing

   make OPTION=32bits





MAKEFILES
---------

Three makefiles are involved during compilation.

1) The top-level 'Makefile' determines the configuration
   and compilation mode. It sets several variables that
   are passed to a recursive 'make' command.

2) The recursive 'make' uses 'Makefile.build'. This
   second makefile may create build directories and
   subdirectories and invoke another recursive 'make'
   command.

3) The last 'make' command will use the 'Makefile' located
   in the './src' or './tests/unit' directories.





BUILD COMMANDS
--------------

The build commands are of the form

   make <target> 'OPTION=<...>' 'MODE=<mode>'

The OPTION part can be used to select an alternative platform,
if it's omitted, the default platform will be selected.


The possible options are as follows:

a) On systems that support both 32bit and 64bit builds

   OPTION=32bits          select 32bit compilation
   OPTION=64bits          select 64bit compilation


b) on Cygwin, OPTION can be given to build for Windows native
   using the mingw compilers:

   OPTION=no-cygwin       build for Windows/32bits
   OPTION=mingw32

   OPTION=mingw64         build for Windows/64bits




The possible modes are as follows:

   MODE=release           (default mode: compile with optimization enabled)
   MODE=debug             debug mode, no optimization
   MODE=devel             same optimizations as release, compiled with assertions

   MODE=profile
   MODE=gcov
   MODE=valgrind
   MODE=quantify
   MODE=purify


The last five modes select compilation flags to enable (or help) runtime
analysis of the Yices executable using 'gprof', 'gcov', 'valgrind', etc.

NOTE: for analysis with 'valgrind', it's usually sufficient to compile
      with 'MODE=debug'. MODE=valgrind is required in rare cases, when
      some bug manifests itself only when the code is compiled with
      optimizations.


MODE=devel was added in September 2012. It is for development. In this
mode, the same compilation flags are used as MODE=release. But
MODE=devel enables use of modules for tracing/printing/debugging that
are not part of the normal distribution.


The main targets are:

   all			   build libraries + executables for the given platform

   binary-distribution     build tarfile for a Yices binary distribution
                           (this distribution is dynamically linked against GMP)

   static-distribution     tarfile for a Yices static distribution
                           (statically linked against GMP)

   source-distribution     build a tarfile containing the Yices sources

   doc                     build the documentation  


Variants for the mingw distributions:

   dist			   prepare for a standard distribution (dynamically linked)

   static-dist             prepare for a static distribution

   tarfile                 build a standard distribution tarfile
                           (after dist + manual construction of lib file)

   static-tarfile          build a static distribution tarfile
                           (after static-dist + manual construction of lib file)



Other possible targets:

   obj                     object files (for dynamic linking)
   static-obj              object files (for static linking)

   lib                     libraries (dynamically linked against GMP)
   static-lib              libraries (statically linked against GMP)

   bin                     executables (dynamically linked against GMP)
   static-bin              executables (statically linked against GMP)

   test			   test programs (dynamically linked)
   static-test             test programs (statically linked)

   sat			   sat solvers (dynamically linked)
   static-sat              sat solvers (statically linked)

   install                 install libraries/executables/header files on
                           the current machine

   show-config             show some data about the configuration
   show-details            show more data about the configuration

   check		   run the regression tests (in tests/regress)
   regress                 samt thing as 'check'


For cleanup:

   clean		   remove everything in ./build/<platform>-<mode>

   arch-clean              remove everything in ./build/<platform>-*

   all-clean               remove everything in ./build/ and the generated
                           files in ./src






NOTES FOR LINUX BUILDS
----------------------

1) Default build

On most Linux distributions, GMP and gperf can be installed using a
package management systems (e.g., 'apt-get' on Ubuntu). It's also
straightforward to build and install them from the sources.

The only issue may be that libgmp.a is not position-independent by
default. So another version of GMP may have to be built. Check doc/GMP
for help on building a position-independent 'libgmp.a'.

Assuming GMP and gperf are in their default location, the following
steps should work:

  ./configure --with-pic-gmp=<full-path-to-pic-ligmp.a>

  make all

  make binary-distribution

  make static-distribution


NOTES:

1) For increased portability, it's better to build Yices on an older
   distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 8.04). Newer distributions have new
   versions of glibc, which can introduce incompatibilities. Also, the
   versions we build on Linux 2.6 won't run on old Linux 2.4 kernels.


2) If there are several versions of libgmp.so and libgmp.a on the
   build machine, it's a good idea to set LDFLAGS and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   correctly so that the right one is picked. If GMP is built with
   default options, it will install in /usr/local/lib, but there may be
   another version in /usr/lib (which is put there by apt-get install).

   In most cases, we want to use the GMP libraries in /usr/local/lib.
   To find a usable libgmp.a, the configure script first searches the
   directories that occur in LDFLAGS if any, then in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   So we must either have '/usr/local/lib' before '/usr/lib' in
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or set LDFLAGS correctly.  Also when we link using
   -lgmp, we want to force the linker to find /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so
   first (rather than /usr/lib/libgmp.so). To achieve this, the
   simplest trick is to give LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib as an option to
   the ./configure script.



2) Building for 32bits on a 64bit Linux machine

It's possible to build 32bit code on a 64bit Linux machine.
This depends on GCC and on whether the support 32bit libraries are
present on the machine. On Ubuntu, these 32bit libraries can be
installed using 'apt-get'.

To build Yices for 32bit, the first step is to install GMP for 32bit
(compiled from the source). Check doc/GMP for help.

To force compilation in 32bit mode, add the flag -m32 to CFLAGS:

  ./configure --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu CFLAGS=-m32

   make all OPTION=32bits

   make binary-distribution OPTION=32bits

   make static-distribution OPTION=32bits



NOTES:

It may be necessary to give some options to the linker as follows:

  ./configure --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu CFLAGS=-m32 LD='ld -melf_i386'

It may also be necessary to use the --with-pic-gmp option.

As before, LDFLAGS can be used to pick the right libgmp.so if there are
several of them on the build machine.



NOTES FOR MAC OS BUILDS
-----------------------

The hardest part is usually to install GMP. Check doc/GMP for help.
Also, it's a good idea to install GMP from the source (and install it
in the default directory /usr/local/lib) rather than use Darwin port.
Once GMP is installed, the build should work fine on any Mac OS X
platform (including older powerpc hardware).

It may also be required to install a newer version of autoconf than
the one that comes by default on Mac OS (I haven't checked whether
this is still true for newer versions of the OS).

Compiling in 32bits and 64bits should work on Intel MACs that run
Mac OS 10.5 or newer. However the default platform depends on the OS
version:

- on 10.5 (Leopard)
  the default is 32bit compilation
  the default platform is of the form i386-apple-darwin9.x.y
  (the x.y part varies with OS updates)

- since 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
  the default is 64bit compilation
  default platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.x.y

There are also issues with having 32 and 64bit versions of GMP
on the same machine. I normally use fat libraries, and a hack
that allows me to have two copies of gmp.h (one for 32bits,
one for 64bits). Check utils/gmp-hack.h for this.

There are incompatibilities between the different OS versions so a
version built on Mac OS 10.6 may not work on Mac OS 10.5 or older.
To increase portability, it's a good idea to give option

    -mmacosx-version-min=10.5

to GCC.  I don't know if we can go back more than that (i.e.,
-mmacosx-version-min=10.4)?.

For compatibility with Mac OS 10.5, we may also need

    -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk

but it doesn't seem to be required for Yices 2 (so far).

Update: option -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
does  not work out of the box, because the GMP header file
<gmp.h> is not found in /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk.
A work around is to add a symbolic link to /usr/local/include
in /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk/usr/local.



The instructions below assume compilation on an Mac running
Snow Leopard (i.e., Mac OS 10.6.8) and with GMP installed in
/usr/local/lib.

1) Default build

   ./configure --with-pic-gmp=<path-to-pic-libgmp.a> \
               CFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=10.5

   make all

   make binary-distribution

   make static-distribution




2) Build for 32bit on Mac OS X 10.6

   ./configure --build=i386-apple-darwin10.8.0 \
               --with-pic-gmp=<path-to-pic-libgmp.a> \
               CFLAGS='-m32 -mmacosx-version-min=10.5'

   make all OPTION=32bits

   make binary-distribution OPTION=32bits

   make static-distribution OPTION=32bits




3) Build for 64bits on Mac OS X 10.5

   ./configure --build=x86_64-apple-darwin9.2.2 \
               --with-pic-gmp=.... \
               CFLAGS='-m64'

   make all OPTION=64bits

   make binary-distribution OPTION=64bits

   make static-distribution OPTION=64bits





NOTES: on MacOS X Lion and newer versions, things may be a bit different:

1) Xcode 4.x for Lion no longer includes gcc as compiler. Instead, it
   includes some versions of llvm-gcc and clang. I tried using Xcode
   4.1: the llvm-gcc that comes with it is buggy (it seg-faults while
   compiling Yices). The clang 2.1 distributed with Xcode 4.1 seems to
   work for compiling but it does not understand option -MG.

   Possible workaround: install llvm+clang 3.0 and use that.


2) Binaries and libraries are expected to all be position independent
   on MacOS X Lion and Mavericks. This causes some issues with GMP (at
   least with GMP 5.0.2).  A solution is to build libgmp.a using
   position-independent flags (see the nodes in doc/GMP on how to do
   that).





NOTES FOR CYGWIN AND MINGW BUILDS
---------------------------------

It's somewhat more complicated to build Yices with both static and
dynamic GMP libraries on Cygwin and Mingw than on other platforms. The
issue is that GMP can't be installed in the standard place as both a
static and a dynamic library. That's because each library uses a
different 'gmp.h' include file (which is by default in /usr/include).


A solution is to compile GMP twice from the source and install the
dynamic and static libraries in different locations:

1) First, build GMP as a dynamic library in the default location.
   This can be done by giving options

        --enable-shared --disable-static

   when configuring GMP. This will build

       /usr/lib/libgmp.dll.a
       /usr/bin/cyggmp-3.dll

   The corresponding 'gmp.h' will be in /usr/include.

2) Build GMP as a static library in a different location (say
   /tools/static_gmp/). This can be done by giving options

      --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=/tools/static_gmp

   to GMP's configure script.  This will build

       /tools/static_gmp/lib/libgmp.dll.a

   and the corresponding 'gmp.h' will be in /tools/static_gmp/include.


After you've done that, you need to give special flags to the Yices's
configure script so that it can find 'libgmp.a' in its nonstandard
location and the corresponding 'gmp.h'. The best way to do this is
to configure Yices using:

    ./configure --with-static-gmp=/tools/static_gmp/lib/libgmp.dll.a \
                --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/tools/static_gmp/include


Then the build should work using the default commands:

    make all

    make binary-distribution

    make static-distribution


NOTE: On both Cygwin and Mingw, the static 'libgmp.a' is position
      independent code so there's no need to specify a different PIC
      gmp.  Option --with-pic-gmp should not be used on Cygwin or
      Mingw.



NOTE: Possible compiler issue on Cygwin (noted 2010/11/16).

On the cygwin version just installed on a Windows 7 machine, there are
two gcc version (/usr/bin/gcc-3 and /usr/bin/gcc-4). The gcc-4 does
not compile Yices in static mode (i.e., make static-bin fails). This
seems to be due to the lack of libgcc_s.a on that installation.  Don't
know what this library is about. Possible fixes:

1) Force compilation with gcc-3: give CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3 to the
   ./configure script

2) Add option -static-libgcc when building in static mode (cf. src/Makefile)




BUILDING A WINDOWS 32bit VERSION FROM CYGWIN
--------------------------------------------

On Cygwin, the default compilation produces code that requires Cygwin
libraries at run time. This code cannot run on a native Windows
machine that does not have Cygwin installed.

To build a version of Yices that can run on a native Windows machine,
you can either install Mingw and msys and compile from there, or
compile from Cygwin using --build=i686-pc-mingw32 to select a Mingw32
configuration.  For the result to work, you must either give the flag
-mno-cygwin to GCC or use a cross compiler. Using -mno-cygwin is
easier but may no longer be supported by new versions of GCC.


OLD METHOD: Using the -mno-cygwin flag

To do this, type

   ./configure --build=i686-pc-mingw32 CFLAGS=-mno-cygwin

This will produce configuration file 'make.include.i686-pc-mingw32' in
directory ./configs. To use this configuration file rather than the
default, add OPTION=no-cywgin when invoking make. For example,

   make all OPTION=no-cygwin

The result will be in ./build/i686-pc-mingw32-release/

You need to have a version of GMP compiled for mingw32 for this to
work. The path to that library can be given using --with-static-gmp,
etc. or by giving options LDPATH=... CPPFLAGS=... to ./configure




MEW METHOD: Using a cross compiler

1) Get the cross compiler: start 'setup.exe' in Windows
   then install the packages 'mingw64-i686-gcc' and relatives.

   The cross compiler is /usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc


2) Build and install a 32bit version of GMP using the cross compiler
   (read doc/GMP).

   Two versions of GMP must be installed. On my machine, the dynamic
   GMP library was built with
     --prefix=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32

   and the static version was built with
     --prefix=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/static


3) Configure yices as follows:

   ./configure --build=i686-pc-mingw32 \
        CC=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc \
        LD=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ld \
        STRIP=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-strip \
        RANLIB=/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib \
	CPPFLAGS=-I/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/include \
	LDFLAGS=-L/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/lib \
        --with-static-gmp=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/static/lib/libgmp.a \
        --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/static/include



3a) Aternative method: use --host=i686-w64-ming32 when running ./configure

   ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
        CPPFLAGS=-I/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/include \
	LDFLAGS=-L/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/lib \
        --with-static-gmp=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/static/lib/libgmp.a \
        --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/home/bruno/tools/mingw32/static/include



4) Compile using OPTION=mingw32 (or OPTION=no-cygwin)

     make all OPTION=mingw32

     make dist OPTION=mingw32

     make static-dist OPTION=mingw32


5) Build the library files 'liyices.lib' by hand (using the Visual Studio 'lib' tool)
   See the notes below for help on how to do this.


6) Build the tar files

    make tarfile OPTION=mingw32

    make static-tarfile OPTION=mingw32






BUILDING A WINDOWS 64bit VERSION FROM CYGWIN
----------------------------------------------

This can be done using the mingw64 cross compiler on Cygwin.

1) To get the cross compiler, start the setup.exe utility in
   Windows. Then install the packages  mingw64-x86_64-gcc and
   relatives. These are in section 'devel' of 'setup.exe'

   The mingw64 compiler is installed as /usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc

2) Build and install a 64bit version of GMP. Read doc/GMP for help.

   There should be two versions of GMP/64bits installed for Yices to
   configure properly.

   On my Dell laptop: the dynamic GMP/64bits library was installed with
     --prefix=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64

   The static GMP/64bits library was installed with
     --prefix=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static

   So this means that we have the following files:

      /home/bruno/tools/mingw64/bin/libgmp-10.dll        (GMP DLL)
      /home/bruno/tools/mingw64/lib/libgmp.dll.a         (corresponding lib file)
      /home/bruno/tools/mingw64/include/gmp.h            (corresponding include)

      /home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/lib/libgmp.a      (static GMP)
      /home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/include/gmp.h     (corresponding include)


3) Assuming this installation, configure Yices as follows

    ,/configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
	CPPFLAGS=-I/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/include \
	LDFLAGS=-L/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/lib \
        --with-static-gmp=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/lib/libgmp.a \
        --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/include

  or like this

    ./configure --build=x86_64-pc-mingw32 \
        CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
        LD=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ld \
        STRIP=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip \
        RANLIB=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib \
	CPPFLAGS=-I/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/include \
	LDFLAGS=-L/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/lib \
        --with-static-gmp=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/lib/libgmp.a \
        --with-static-gmp-include-dir=/home/bruno/tools/mingw64/static/include

   To select this configuration give 'OPTION=mingw64' to the make commands.




FOR WINDOWS/MINGW DISTRIBUTIONS: MANUAL STEPS TO BUILD libyices.lib
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This must be done when building the mingw32 or mingw64 distributions
(after make dist or make static-dist, and before make tarfile or make
static-tarfile). This requires Visual Studio to be installed on the
machine (the free version, Visual Studio Express is good enough for
this).


For a 32bit Windows distribution (mingw32):

1) Open a Visual studio C++ command prompt (in Windows)

2) Go to the directory dist/lib or static_dist/lib directory for
   Yices/mingw32:

      c:\cygwin\home\...\build\i686-pc-mingw32-release\dist\lib
   or c:\cygwin\home\...\build\i686-pc-mingw32-release\static_dist\lib

   These directories should contain:

       libyices.a
       libyices.dll.a
       libyices.dll
       libyices.def

3) From the Visual studio prompt, type

       lib /def:libyices.def /machine:x86

   This will create libyices.lib and libyices.exp

4) Cleanup: delete libyices.def and libyices.exp
   (they are not needed).

5) Build the tarfile.



For 64bit Windows distribution (mingw64):

The libraries are in

      c:\cygwin\home\...\build\x86_64-pc-mingw32\dist\lib
  and c:\cygwin\home\...\build\x86_64-pc-mingw32\static_dist\lib


The procedure is the same as for mingww32, except in step 3.

To create a lib file for 64bit Windows (x86_64 hardware), use:

       lib /def:libyices.def /machine:x64



NOTE: It's also possible to call the Visual Studio 'lib' utility
      directly from Cygwin, provided the executable and the DLL(s)
      it requires are in the PATH. The Yices source contains
      a shell script

        './utils/setup-vs2010'

      that does it for my Windows machine. This script must probably
      be adjusted depending on the Visual Studio Version and location.
      It must be run from a Cygwin shell (bash) using

         source ./utils/setup-vs1010


NOTE: (Updated 2011/12/01). There's a shell script in ./utils that
      makes it easier to build the Windows 32/64 bits distributions
      from cygwin.



GCC GIVES WARNINGS ABOUT INLINED FUNCTIONS
------------------------------------------

Compiling yices with gcc-4.4 with the default options causes a
lot of warnings of the form:

warning: inlining failed in call to 'xxx': call is unlikely and code size would grow

The yices functions that are declared 'inline' are small and do not
cause much code growth. So these warnings are annoying.

Similar warnings are produced by other versions of GCC too (e.g.,
GCC-4.5.3 for mingw32 and mingw64).

The warnings are caused by heuristics that GCC employs to determine
whether it is worth inlining a function call. GCC attempts to
determine whether a basic block is executed frequently enough before
inlining the function calls in that block. By default, GCC uses crude
heuristics to guess the execution frequency of each block (and other
heuristics to estimate code growth).

The part about 'code size would grow' can be misleading. The warning
will be produced even if inlining does not cause any code growth at
all, probably because the code-growth estimate is not very accurate.


The preferred way to fix this is to add option -fno-guess-branch-probability 
to CFLAGS when configuring Yices:

  ./configure CFLAGS=-fno-guess-branch-probability


Other ways to prevent these warnings:

1) remove -Winline from the compilation flags in src/Makefile.
   GCC will inline whatever it wants and there will be no warnings.

2) add  __attribute__ ((always_inline)) to the inline functions that cause
   problem. GCC will stop checking whether the size grows and whether the
   call is likely.

3) play with the parameters that control what GCC considers high enough frequency
   (e.g., add option --param hot-bb-frequency-fraction=2000)
