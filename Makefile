# Version numbers: <version>.<minor>.<patch-level>
# - this determines the name of the distribution tarfile
# - the number is also used in the shared library
#   for linux:  the soname is libyices.so.<major>.<minor>
#   for darwin: the compatibility version is <major>.<minor>.0
#               the version is set to <major>.<minor>.<patch-level>
#
# Conventions we should follow:
# <major> increases for major new releases.
# <minor> increases when we make changes that loose
#         backward compatibility.
# <patch-level> increases for bug fixes or other improvements
#         that maintain backward compatibility.
#
# Example: if P is linked against libyices.so version 2.0.0
# - P should still work (without recompliling) with libyices 2.0.1
# - P should not work anymore with libyices 2.1.0 or 3.0.0

# OPTION: select an alternative configuration file
#
# 1) On Mac OS X Leopard/intel (darwin9.X.Y), the default configuration is
#    in file  make.include.i386-apple-darwin9.X.Y
#    This builds Yices as a 32bit executable.
#
#    It's possible to use an alternative configuration file
#       make.include.x86_64-apple-darwin9.Y.Z on the same system.
#    This is intended to build Yices as 64bit code.
#
#    To select the alternative configuration use 'make OPTION=64bits ..'
#
# 1a) Since Mac OS X Snow Leopard (darwin10.X.Y) and newer, the default
#     is reversed. The default configuration is in file
#        make.include.x86_64-apple-darwin10.X.Y
#     This builds Yices for 64bit by default.
#
#     To build for 32bit on the same system, use the alternative
#     configuration file  make.include.i386-apple-darwin10.X.Y
#
#     To select the alternative configuration use 'make OPTION=32bits ...'
#
# 2) On Linux/x86_64, we compile in 64 bit mode by default,
#    using configuration file make.include.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
#
#    It may be possible to build in 32 bit mode on the same machine,
#    provided the compiler understand option -m32 and the necessary
#    32bit libraries are present. The corresponding Yices configuration
#    is make.include.i686-unknown-linux-gnu
#
#    To select this 32bit configuration, use 'make OPTION=32bits ...'
#
# 3) On cygwin, the default configuration is make.include.i686-pc-cygwin.
#    Two alternatives are supported:
#         make.include.i686-pc-mingw32    (mingw32/Windows 32bit native)
#    and  make.include.x86_64-pc-mingw32  (Windows 64bit native)
#
#    To select the Windows 32bit configuration, use
#          'make OPTION=no-cygwin ...'
#       or 'make OPTION=mingw32 ...'
#
#    To select the Windows 64bit configuration, use
#         'make OPTION=mingw64'
#
#    Issue: 2013/12/11: this Makefile is not robust for
#    cross-compilation on Cygwin (to produce Windows 64 code).
#    The simplest way to configure for this cross-compilation is
#       ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 ....
#
#    This generates ./configs/makefile.include.x86_64-w64-mingw32.
#    But OPTION=mingw64 gives ./configs/makefile.include.x86_64-pc-mingw32
#
#
# 4) On solaris, the default is make.include.sparc-sun-solaris2.x
#    (should be 32bits).
#
#    The alternative is make.include.sparc64-sun-solaris2.x
#    (should be for 64bits build). To select it, give OPTION=64bits.
#
# Check README for details on generating these alternative configurations.
